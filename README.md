# Music and Mental Health: Tableau Dashboard  

## Overview  
This project explores the relationship between **music listening habits** and **mental health** using data-driven insights. The dashboard visualizes how different **music genres**, **listening durations**, and **age groups** correlate with **mental well-being**.  

## Key Insights  
- **Young adults (20-34 years old)** experience peak levels of anxiety and depression, which stabilize with age but resurface in seniors (60+).  
- **Listening to music** is associated with **mood improvement**, particularly among younger individuals.  
- **Genres like Latin and Jazz** show the highest listening durations, while Lofi and Gospel report **100% mood improvement rates**.  
- **Different genres serve different therapeutic roles**, from **stress reduction** (Classical, Jazz) to **mood elevation** (Pop, Latin).  

## Data Source  
The dataset used for this visualization comes from **Kaggle**:

## Limitations  
- The dataset may lack **global representation**, leading to potential biases.  
- **Self-reported data** introduces subjectivity, making it difficult to establish causality.  
- **Individual differences** in listening habits limit generalizability.  
- The analysis does not explore potential **negative effects** of music.
